WEB DESIGNER, GAME DEVELOPMENT

Emsad Osmanovic (Emsad11) is a professional web designer, creator of video games for three years. He tries to share his knowledge with others by creating well-designed experiences that are important in the business world. Your website is the center of your digital eco-system, as a brick and mortar location, experience is important once the customer enters, just as perception, they have from you before they enter the door. The designer knows that he achieved perfection not when there's nothing more to add, but when there's nothing left to take away.


Unlike graphic designers who make printed solutions for their employers, web designers design and create web pages, applications, various games, and all they are required to do with the web. Just as we can't study mathematics to learn without knowing the multiplication table, so people can't do web design unless they know its foundations. HTML is the descriptive language of the help created by the sites, the exact functionality of the elements of a single website, so that it is the basis of the web design. Whether they like it or not, web design experts have to know it. In addition, knowledge of CSS is essential, the language used to regulate the appearance itself and formatting all the elements we see on the site. It is also necessary to know the creation of photographs, their processing, animation and optimization for search engines.
